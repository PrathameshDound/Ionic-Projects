    I have great pleasure in expressing my thoughts as the Principal of Sardar Patel Institute of Technology (SPIT), the Numero Uno, self-financed, autonomous Institution of Maharashtra. We are a constituent of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, not just a conglomeration of more than 300 institutions, but a culture, a saga, a holy journey, started by Dr. K.M. Munshi with the support of Mahatma Gandhi in 1938. Imparting value-based education with Indian cultural ethos has always been the motto of Bhavan.
